Diabetes Classification Readme



Following are the steps you would have to take to run the diabetes clasification 
notebook and the web app:

(i) While the notebook can be run on google colab, we recommend you to use the 
jupyter notebook on an anaconda environment as it would make running the web app
easier. The web app has only been tested on an anaconda enviorement.

(ii) Make sure that you have the relevant libraries installed such as, flask and other
data science libraries so you dont face any troubles.

(iii) Unzip the Big Data PBL file. Make sure that you dont move any files from any
of the folders as flask needs certain files to be in their correct folders.

(iv) Run the Jupyter notebook on an anaconda environment. 

(v) Run all cells.

(v) The last cell is the cell for the web app, if run successfully, it will 
mention the web app link.

(vi) Click on the link to reach the web app.

(vii)click on Predict on the web app to start your prediction.


(viii) Fill all of the required datafields, missing any may cause the web app to crash.

(ix) Click on submit to get your result.
